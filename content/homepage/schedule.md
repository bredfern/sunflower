We have a 24 hour cancellation policy if you cancel within 24 hours there will be no charge. Cancellations which are made less than 24 hours before the appointment time will be charged 50% of the scheduled appointment, if we do not have your card on file the cancellation fee will be due before rescheduling.

##### No call no show
Will be charged 100% of the scheduled services and you will be required to leave a card on file for future appointments.

##### Late policies
We have a 15 minute grace period. Please call if you are running late to let your Stylist know. If it is more than 15 minutes you may be required to reschedule. Depending what your scheduled services are,
you may be able to keep the appointment with some alterations for example you may not have time for the blow dry or maybe you were scheduled for a full highlight now thereâ€™s only time for a partial (you will be charged for the original scheduled services for that appointment)

##### Revisions
We do not offer refunds. If you need a revision please contact your stylist within 3 to 5 days of your appointment to request a revision depending on the circumstances there may be a charge.
