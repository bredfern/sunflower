## About the Owner

Lori Lilja has over 20 years experience in the beauty industry. She attended beauty school in 1990 in New York and then moved to California in 2000. Since moving to California, she's continued to work on the west side of Los Angeles.

Lori is extremely passionate about her work, and truly loves the one-on-one experience she has with her clients.

In an industry that is constantly changing and moving, she likes to fine-tune her skills by regularly attending hair shows and furthering her education with classes -- always expanding her expertise with the latest products and techniques.

She gravitates towards hair color; whether it’s gray coverage, balayage/ombré, the perfect shade of blonde, corrective color, or rainbow/ fashion colors -- she loves it all!

Lori also really enjoys cutting hair and working with a variety of clients from all walks of life.

Lori is an art and nature lover, and in her spare time she enjoys traveling the world! She's visited countries like Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, China, Hong Kong and Italy, and hopes to keep growing this list every year. 

She finds inspiration in almost everything -- everywhere she goes.

When she is not in the salon, she likes to practice yoga, hike, horseback ride, and hang out with her Italian greyhound Becky.
